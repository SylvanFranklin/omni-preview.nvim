# Omni Preview 
Lightweight and highly extensible plugin to preview many kinds of files. This plugin does not itself implement preview functionality, but rather provides one unified command to manage 3d party preview plugins. It also provides documentation and configuration examples for many common workflows. 

Supported Previews: 
- [x] Markdown
- [x] Typst
- [x] Images, SVGs, other system standard files
- [x] CSV 
- [x] Running npm servers
- [ ] Latex (document this)
- [x] PDFs

**Features**
- [ ] Ability to toggle all previews on and off.
- [ ] Extend with any number of previews

One day I would love to make this plugin behave like Mason.nvim and have a nice list of sources that can be used to install different preview plugins, but that is long in the future and will require a large amount of understanding.
